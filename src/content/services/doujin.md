### Send content made in WarioWare DIY directly to your Wii.

<a href="https://diy.tvc-16.science/" class="btn btn-danger" style="color:white !important; margin-top:5px; width:100%;"><i class="fa fa-truck"></i> Check out DoujinSoft's site!</a>

DoujinSoft is the largest website for WarioWare DIY content. It has almost all content that was on Nintendo WFC prior to its shutdown, and it lets you view the content directly in your browser. Using WiiLink's mail service, a patched version of WarioWare DIY Showcase, and the WiiLink DNS, you can send any content on the website directly to your copy of the game.
